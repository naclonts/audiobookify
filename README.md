## Introduction

The **PDF to Speech Converter** is a web application that allows users to upload PDF documents and receive high-quality spoken audio as output. Users can choose from multiple voice options, ensuring a personalized listening experience. The application processes the PDF by extracting and cleaning the text before converting it to speech using advanced text-to-speech (TTS) models.

---

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload PDF files directly through the web interface.
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from a variety of high-quality voices.
- **Text Cleaning**: Automatic removal of headers, footers, and hyphenations for smooth narration.
- **Audio Playback and Download**: Listen to the generated audio online or download it for offline use.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Efficient handling of large files without blocking the user interface.
- **Modular Design**: Separate backend and frontend components for scalability and maintainability.

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```

Ensure that the backend server is running at `http://localhost:5000/`.

### 2. Start the Celery Worker

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
celery -A app.controllers.tasks.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

This starts the Celery worker to process tasks asynchronously.

### 3. Start the Frontend Server

Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.
